Sublime Text is great, but it's sidebar doesn't match the default (and beautiful) dark Monokai theme. Thanks to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/umpirsky/5842174) and after tweaking it a little (I corrected a glitch with the code collapse icon and made the higlight color lighter), I finally made it look great:

Simply, put "Default.sublime-theme" file in "[SUBLIME]/packages/Theme - Default directory".

Windows : C:\Users\userName\AppData\Local\Sublime Text 3\Cache\Theme - Default
